# Multiple HTML Apps

A collection of simple, standalone web applications built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each app is designed to be lightweight, functional, and easy to use.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for running the development server)
- A modern web browser

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fernandobelotto/multi-html-apps.git
cd multi-html-apps
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
